			<p>
				The purpose of this website is to discuss an important technology that has made today's web possible.
				It approaches this from a physics perspective.
				Typically the foundation of computer science is mathematics, and physics is more responsible for computer engineering or computer architecture.
				However, here we will try to draw a path from the physics topic of electrodynamics to the abstracted electronics technology of logic gates.

				You are encouraged to peruse this site as fits your needs.
				You can read it from start to finish.
				You can follow along with some of the example calculations.
				You can jump from section to section as interests you.
				You are encouraged to check the reference materials out for yourself for more in-depth information.
				This website is not all-encompassing for any of the topics discussed here,
				but I hope that it has some value if you are interested in physics and computing.
