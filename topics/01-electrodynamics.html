				Computers don't necessarily need to be electrical devices.
				Humans were using devices to aid them with their calculations long before 
				Charles Coulomb measured the strength of the electric force between charges with his torsion balance

				The abacus was a mechanical calculating device used thousands of years before that which allowed for the representation and manipulation of large numbers in base ten.
				Slide rules have been used since the seventeenth century to do operations like multiplication and division or calculate functions like logarithms or exponentials

				But this discussion is about the science and technology behind logic gates which in there most important implementations are electrical devices.
				Therefore, we will not discuss purely mechanical computation and instead will begin with some of the
				fundamentals of electricity and magnetism that are at the lowest levels of abstraction that make
				logic gates possible.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Standard Model of particle physics includes many different particles that have an intrinsic electric charge.
				However, only the negative electron and positive proton need to be considered to understand computing as of yet.
				The magnitude of the charge of either of these particles is \(1.60\times10^{-19}\) Coulombs (C).
			</p>
			<p>
				These charged protons and electrons are found within atoms. The positive protons are
				bound within the nucleus and the negative electrons exist outside the nucleus. The electrons are more easily freed from
				the confines of the atom. Thus the freed electrons can move about from one atom to another or through free space.
				Normally an atom has an equal amount of protons and electrons so the total charge is zero and the atom is neutral.
				Matter is composed of atoms and most matter will be neutral.
				However, since the electrons can be removed from the atom you can have a sample of matter that is missing electrons
				and has a net positive charge. You might have another sample that has extra electrons and has a net negative charge.
				This is how we can have macroscopic charges greater than the \(1.60\times10^{-19}\) C.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can have uneven distributions of charge since the electrons can move,
				but we also need to pay special attention to those moving charges.
				Moving charges produce a current.
				The current, \(I\), running through a cross-sectional area can be described by 
			</p>
			<p>
			\begin{equation}I=\frac{dq}{dt}\tag{1}\end{equation} 
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(dq\) is the amount of charge passing the cross-section during a time interval, \(dt\). If there is a steady
				flow of charge in time then that is a steady current. If you have a steady current you can forget about the charges
				and now just deal in currents.
			</p>
			<p>
				So now we have two phenomena. We have charges and we have currents. What you need to know first is that charges produce
				electric fields and currents produce magnetic fields. The equations describing the production of these fields are
				described by a form of Coulomb's law as well as the Biot-Savart law.
				These equations require integral and vector calculus. However, we can get an intuition for how these sources
				produces these fields by looking at the cases of a point charge or a current-carrying wire.
				A point charge, \(q\), produces an electric field, E, according to
			</p>
			<p>
			\begin{equation}E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\tag{2}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(r\) is the distance between the charge and the point where you are measuring the electric field
				and \(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space which is \(8.85\times10^{-12}\) farads per meter (F/m).
				The strength of the electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge.
				So the field is strong close to the charge and gets weaker and weaker as you get farther away.
				Another important point is that the electric field is a vector and so it has a magnitude and direction.
				If the charge is positive, the electric field will point away from the charge.
				if the charge is negative, the electric field will point toward the charge (see Fig. 1).

			</figure>
			<p>
				Magnetic fields can be produced by magnetic materials.
				but magnetic materials have a collection of microscopic currents in them that produce the magnetic fields.
				So the most important thing to remember is that currents produced magnetic fields.
				For example, a wire carrying a current, \(I\), will produce a magnetic field, \(B\), according to 
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}B=\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I}{r}\tag{3}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The constant \(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space which is \(1.25\times10^{-6}\) henries per meter (H/m).
				The perpendicular distance from the wire to the point where you are measuring the field is \(r\).
			</p>
			<p>
				The next important concept is that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field
				and a changing electric field produces a magnetic field. Combine these two rules
				with the fact that static charges also produce electric fields and steady currents also
				produce magnetic fields as discussed earlier.
				These four effects are summarized in Maxwell's equations
				but those equations require vector calculus to denote.
				However, these effects explain all of electrodynamics and govern all the physics of electricity, magnetism,
				circuits, and electronics as long as quantum effects are ignored.
				We will in fact not ignore quantum effects when we discuss transistors,
				but first we will discuss circuits in the next section.
