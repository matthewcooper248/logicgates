			<p>
				To understand transistors we have to consider special types of semiconductors that have been doped.
				A doped semiconductor has some of its atoms replaced with atoms of another kind
				which slightly alters the energy levels that are available to the electrons.

			<p>
				In Fig. 11, a semiconductor has had a small fraction of its atoms replaced with
				atoms that provide an extra higher energy level that is slightly inside the band gap.
				This extra energy level is small enough that some electrons can jump to these higher energy levels
				just from thermal fluctuations.
				The electrons leave behind empty energy levels that are not occupied by electrons.
				These empty energy levels are called holes.
				They act like positive charge carriers.
				An electron in some other atom's occupied energy level could jump to this empty orbital leaving its original orbital empty.
				The electron has moved to a different energy occupation, but you can also say
				that the hole has moved to a different energy level.
				These positive holes can move around the semiconductor and produce currents.
				This type of semiconductor is called p-type because the positive holes are free to move and carry charge.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other type of doped semicondutor is the n-type.
				It is shown in Fig. 12.
			</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				In an n-type semiconductor, some of the atoms are replaced with different atoms that
				add an extra energy level just below the top of the band gap.
				These energy levels are so close to the energy levels above the band gap
				that the electrons can easily jump to the higher energy levels due to thermal fluctuations.
				These electrons are then free to move about above the band gap and conduct charge.
				The freely moving electrons are negative charge carriers
				so these type of semiconductors are referred to as n-type.
			</p>
			<p>
				The usefulness of these differently doped semiconductors arises
				when they are placed next to each other as depicted in Fig. 13 (a).
			</p>
			<figure>

			<p>
				In the n-type semiconductor on the left, the electrons are free to move to the unoccupied energy levels on the right.
				The holes are free to move from the p-type semiconductor to the n-type semiconductor.
				The electrons above the band gap can lose energy and switch to occupying
				the electron orbitals of holes below the band gap.
				This will cause a positive region in the n-type semiconductor just to the left of the junction
				and a negative region in the p-type semiconductor just to the right of the junction.
				This creates a potential difference at the junction.
				The potential difference is a result of a net electric field that points
				from the positive region to the negative region.
				An electric field produces a force on charges.
				At the junction there is a force that opposes the movement of electrons
				from the n-type material to the p-type material.
				A force can also be represented by potential energy.
				The force pushing electrons back toward the n-type material can be represented by
				a difference in energy of the orbital electron occupations between
				the n-type material and the p-type material as depicted in Fig. 13 (b).
			</p>
			<p>
				If a DC voltage were applied to each end of this junction,
				it could supplement or detract from this potential difference
				affecting the ability for charge carriers to move.
				If a positive voltage is applied to the n-type material,
				it will increase the energy difference between the two materials
				which will make it even harder for charge to flow.
				If the voltage direction is reversed,
				it will decrease the energy difference between the two materials
				which will make it easier for charge to flow.
				This directionality will be key to the importance of transistors
				utilizing n-type and p-type materials.

				We are now ready to discuss the npn junction

				If A large voltage is applied between the two n-type materials in the direction shown in Fig. 14,
				then the energy difference between the np junction will become very large
				and the energy difference between the pn junction will become very small.
				Because the energy difference between the np junction is very large,
				no current will flow across the circuit.
				Consider, though, a smaller voltage applied between the p-type and n-type material
				as depicted by the small DC voltage source in the right section of Fig. 14.
				This will allow electrons to flow from the p-type end of the small DC voltage source
				to the n-type end which will allow current to flow across the entire npn junction
				and the entire circuit.
				The application of a small voltage in the right side of Fig. 14
				enabled the flow of current across the large voltage in the bottom of Fig. 14.
				This is the key of transistors.
				The npn junction isn't the only type of transistor
				where a small voltage can control a larger one but it is an exemplary one.
				In the next section, we will use these types of transistors
				to create the logic gates which makes computing possible.
