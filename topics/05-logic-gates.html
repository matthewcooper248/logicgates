				logic gates

			<p>
				The information on semiconductors that was discussed in the previous section
				makes the transistor possible.
				The archetypical transistor is the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).
				The MOSFET looks like Fig. 15.

			<p>
				A MOSFET transistor is similar to the npn junction we discussed in the earlier section.
				The most important feature is that a small voltage applied to the gate terminal, \(G\),
				can turn on and off a larger voltage applied between the source terminal, \(S\),
				and the drain terminal, \(D\).
				This is the general prinicple for how a gate works.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will now look at how we can represent this process symbolically
				while ignoring the physical structure of gates.
				The following symbol in Fig 16. represents a gate regardless of how it is physically constructed.
			</p>

			<p>
				A small voltage applied to the base, \(B\),
				will turn on and off a larger voltage between the emitter, \(E\) and the collector, \(C\).
				These gates are a basic unit that can be wired together in various configurations to perform
				different types of logical operations.
				This is a good time to introduce the concept of a truth table.
				\(B\) can be either on or off.
				\(B\) is the input.
				\(C\) is the output.
				When a small voltage is applied to \(B\) we consider that to be a value of \(1\) in binary
				or true in boolean logic.
				When no voltage is applied to \(B\) we consider that to be a value of \(0\) in binary
				or false in boolean logic.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is boolean logic?
				Boolean logic is a product of boolean algebra which was developed by George Boole in the nineteenth century				
				<a 
					href="references.html#ref-07"
					title="[7] G. Boole. An Investigation of the Laws of Thought (Benediction Classics, Cork, 2017)."
				>
				[7]</a>.
				In boolean logic, variables can either have a value of true or false rather than a number.
				Instead of operations like addition and multiplication,
				you have logical operations like and, or, and not.
			</p>
			<p>
				So we have an electrical circuit that can represent logical operations.
				The input is either on or off, \(0\) or \(1\), or true or false.
				The input is the voltage applied to the \(B\) in Fig. 15.
				The output is either on or off, \(0\) or \(1\), or true or false.
				The output is the voltage that comes from \(C\) in Fig. 16.
				We now have an input and output that are electrical signals but they can represent true or false.
				We can summarize what happens to the output of the gate based on the input depicted in Fig. 15 in a truth table
				like the one shown in Table 1.
			</p>

			<p>
				A basic transistor or gate can be referred to as a buffer gate.
				If the input is true, the output is true.
				If the input is false, the output is false.
				This seems simple and not particularly useful.
				However, using this simple buffer gate we can construct more useful logical gates.
			</p>
			<p>
				What if the wire that is output was attached to the emitter instead of the collector that goes to ground?
				This is depicted in Fig. 16.

			</figure>
			<p>
				If a voltage is applied to the base,
				the emitter and collector will be connected.
				The current will flow from the emitter to the collector bypassing the output wire.
				A voltage placed on the input will cause no voltage to be placed on the output.
				If no voltage is placed on the input,
				the emitter collector will not be connected.
				The larger voltage on the emitter will cause the current to instead flow to the output.
				No voltage on the input will produced a voltage on the output.
				The output is always opposite of what the input is.
				This is a not gate and is summarized in table 2.

				The next logical operation that we want to build a circuit for is the and operation
				<a 
					href="references.html#ref-08"
					title="[8] C. Anne. Boolean Logic & Logic Gates: Crash Course Computer Science #3. YouTube, 8 March 2017, https://youtu.be/gI-qXk7XojA."
				>
				[8]</a>.
				Let's say that you now have two inputs, \(A\) and \(B\).
				\(A\) and \(B\) both need to be true for the outcome to be true.
				If both are false, the output is false.
				If only one or the other is true, the output is still false.
				This logical operation can be constructed using the circuit depicted in Fig. 17.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just like before, a large voltage is always applied to the emitter.
				This time there are two base gates, \(A\) and \(B\), which are placed in series.
				These are the inputs.
				Current can only flow from the emitter to the collector if a small voltage is applied
				to both the \(A\) and \(B\) inputs.
				If neither \(A\) or \(B\) is energized then no current can flow.
				If only one of either \(A\) or \(B\) is energized then still no current can flow.
				This logic can be summarized in the truth table in table 3. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The next logical gate we want to construct is an or gate.
				An or gate will also have two inputs, \(A\) and \(B\).
				In this case, only one of these inputs needs to be true for the output to be true.
				If both are true, the output will be true.
				If neither are true, the output will be false.
				An or gate is represented in Fig. 18.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img
					src="../images/or-gate.svg"
					alt="an or gate"
					title="an or gate"

				<figcaption>
					Fig. 18. An or gate.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the and gate, the inputs \(A\) and \(B\) were in series.
				In an or gate, they are in parallel.
				As always a large voltage is applied to the emitter.
				We are looking to determine if an electrical current will be received at the collector which is the output.
				In this parallel circuit, only \(A\) or \(B\) needs to be energized in order for a current to reach the output.
				If \(A\) is energized, then the current can flow from \(E\) to \(A\) to \(C\).
				If \(B\) is energized, then the current can flow from \(E\) to \(B\) to \(C\).
				if neither \(A\) nor \(B\) is energized then there is no path for current to flow from \(E\) to \(C\).
				If they are both energized, then the current can flow from either the top or bottom path to \(C\).
				This logic is summarized in the truth table in table 4.

				This concludes our discussion of how logical operations can be created using gates or transistors.
				This not even close to covering the depth and breadth of logical operations
				that can be made electronically.
				We have only covered some of the logical operations that you may be familiar with in the English language.
				There are other logic gates that are useful and can be constructed like an xor gate.
				I encourage you to do further research on the many types of logic gates
				that are implemented in CPUs to make them fast and powerful.
