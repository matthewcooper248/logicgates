				circuits
			</h2>
			<p>
				All electrical phenomena are explained by Maxwell's equations,
				but we need to introduce some quantities and concepts that will make it easier for us to translate
				how the physics of the previous section governs the properties and dynamics of circuits.
				First let's talk about voltage. Voltage is also known as electromotive force (emf),
				however it is not demensionally equivalent to force.
				But it does act analogous to a force. A voltage or emf will cause free charges to move.
				It is the electric field that is actually producing a force, \(F\), on a free charge, \(q\), according to
				\(F = Eq\), and the voltage is the line integral of the electric field along the path of a circuit.
				But those equations aren't very useful for describing circuits and you should focus on the concept of voltage.
				Confusingly, there is another term for voltage or emf and that is electric potential difference.
			</p>
			<h3>Ohm's law</h3>
			<p>
				A voltage, \(V\), across a circuit will cause free charges to move across it. Moving charges form a current, \(I\),
				so a voltage produces a current. Free charges aren't completely free to move across a circuit.
				The circuit will resist the free movement of charges. This property is called resistance, \(R\), and can be quantified.
				The relationship between the voltage, current, and resistance across a circuit is given by Ohm's law
			</p>
			<p>
			\begin{equation}V=IR\tag{4}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a couple of interesting things to note about Ohm's law.
				Typically the resistance is a constant property of the circuit.
				The voltage is directly proportional to the current.
				So if you increase the voltage you apply across a circuit you will increase the current that flows through it.
				But if you apply the same voltage to a circuit with a larger resistance you won't be able to produce as large of a current.
				Current and resistance are inversely proportional. If you apply a voltage across a circuit with a very small resistance,
				the current will be very large. In the ideal limit, as the resistance goes toward zero, the current will rise to infinity.
				High currents are damaging and dangerous. If you apply a voltage across a circuit with a small resistance, it is likely
				to heat up and eventually break. It also could injure you if you touch it.
				Sometimes something conducting might touch a functioning circuit and bypass the sections of the circuit that have an appropriate resistance.
				This is called a short circuit and will probably cause your circuit to break.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fuses are often used to protect circuits from reaching dangerous current levels.
				A fuse is a resistive element that is placed in a circuit and is made of a weak material by design.
				If the current rises too high it will heat up and destroy the fuse.
				The location of the fuse will then be a gap in the circuit and no current will be allowed to flow even though there is a voltage applied.
				This leads us to another concept.
				A circuit must be closed for current to flow.
				You could say that the gap in the blown fuse actually means that the fuse now has an infinite resistance and that regardless
				of how high the voltage is, the current must be zero according to Ohm's law.
				But a gap in a circuit does not actually have an infinite resistance just a very high one.
				The resistance between the moisture high up in the atmosphere and the ground is very high.
				However, during a thunderstorm, the voltage between the clouds and the ground may increase enough
				and the resistance of the air may go down enough that the atmosphere becomes a closed instead of an
				open circuit and current flows from the atmosphere to the ground. Lightning strikes.

			<h3>series circuits</h3>
			<p>
			The simplest circuit is an emf or voltage source and a resistor like so.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This is the type of circuit that our discussion of Ohm's law could apply to.
				But let's build a more complex circuit.
				What if you have a circuit like this but instead there are two resistors with one after the other in the loop.
				You would say these resistors are in <em>series</em> and it would look like Fig. 3(a).
				What if the first resistor had a resistance of 2 ohms (\(\Omega\))
				and the second resistor had a resistance of 3 \(\Omega\).
				Resistors in series are equivalent to a single resistor with a resistance
				that is the sum of the resistances of all the resistors in series.
				So the circuit in Fig. 3(b) is equivalent to the circuit in Fig. 3(a)
				because a 2 \(\Omega\) resistor and a 3 \(\Omega\) resistor in series
				is equivalent to one 5 \(\Omega\) resistor.

					FIG. 3. Resistors in series. (a) Two resistors of 2 \(\Omega\) and 3 \(\Omega\) in series are equivalent to (b) one resistor of 5 \(\Omega\). 
				</figcaption>
			<p>
				How is current and voltage affected when elements of a circuit are in series?
				Well the current is unchanged. Imagine that the circuit in Fig. 3(a) has a current of 1 ampere (A) across it.
				That would mean that the battery has a current of 1 A across it,
				the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor has 1 A across it,
				and the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor has 1 A across it.
				In a circuit, all the elements that are in series will have the same current across them.
				What about the voltage?
				Let's continue to assume that the battery is causing the circuit to have a current of 1 A across it.
				Let's reconsider Ohm's law in Eq. (4). We know that because the 2 \(\Omega\) and 3 \(\Omega\) resistors
				are in series then the total equivalent resistance of the circuit is 5 \(\Omega\).
				Then using Ohm's law we can find the voltage across the entire circuit like so
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V=IR\tag{5}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V=\left( 1~\mathrm{A} \right)\left(5~\mathrm{\Omega} \right)\tag{6}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V= 5~\mathrm{V} \tag{7}\end{equation}			
			</p>
			<p>
				Dimensionally, one ampere ohm (\(\mathrm{A}\) \(\Omega\)) is equivalent to one volt (\(\mathrm{V}\)) which is the unit for voltage.
				So the voltage across the entire circuit is 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				What is the voltage at each point across the circuit?
				The total voltage is 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				So the voltage at the very beginning of the circuit—which is the battery—is 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				Throughout the entire circuit, the current will stay the same but the voltage will drop after each resistive circuit.
				The arrow at the top of the circuit indicates the direction of current flow.
				Overall the current flows from the positive end of the battery to the negative end.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a good time to stop and discuss the positive and negative convention of physics and circuits.
				We mentioned in the electrodynamics circuits that electrons are negative
				and electrons are the fundamental charged particle that is free to flow.
				So when there is a current, typically it is electrons or negative charges that are moving.
				In the simple circuit depicted in Fig. 3(a), there are electrons starting at the bottom
				side of the battery depicted by the negative sign.
				They then move from there along the loop across the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor, then the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor,
				then finally to the positive end of the battery.
				The direction of flow of the negative charges in this circuit is counterclockwise.
				However, current is defined by the flow of positive charges.
				Strictly speaking, positive charges do not flow in the circuit.
				They are trapped to the nucleus of the atoms they are in and only the negative charges freely flow in the counterclockwise direction.
				But the direction of current is defined by the direction of flow of positive charges.
				Positive charges generally don't flow but the reality is that
				negative charges flowing in the counterclockwise direction is mathematically equivalent to positive charges flowing in the clockwise direction.
				So the direction of current flow in Fig. 3(a) is clockwise from the positive end of the battery across the circuit to the battery's negative end.
				When analyzing circuits always remember the current will flow from the positive end to the negative end.
			</p>
			<p>
				We begin at the positive terminal of the battery on the left side of the circuit in Fig. 3(a).
				The voltage at this point is 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				We then go clockwise along the loop of the circuit until we get to the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor.
				We are considering an idealization of a circuit where the wire between elements has no resistance.
				The voltage hasn't changed from the positive end of the battery to the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor.
				The voltage is  5 \(\mathrm{V}\) right before 2 \(\Omega\) resistor.
				But the voltage will decrease across the resistor according to Ohm's law.
				Let's calculate how much the voltage drops across this resistor.
				This is called a voltage drop.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Delta V=IR\tag{8}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Delta V=\left( 1~\mathrm{A} \right)\left(2~\mathrm{\Omega} \right)\tag{9}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Delta V= 2~\mathrm{V} \tag{10}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				So the voltage drops 2 \(\mathrm{V}\) across the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor from 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) to 3 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				Now the voltage won't change as we move from the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor to the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor.
				The voltage right before the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor is 3 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				Let's calculate the voltage drop across the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\Delta V=IR\tag{11}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Delta V=\left( 1~\mathrm{A} \right)\left(3~\mathrm{\Omega} \right)\tag{12}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\Delta V= 3~\mathrm{V} \tag{13}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				So the voltage drops 3 \(\mathrm{V}\) across the 3 \(\Omega\) resistor.
				It drops from 3 \(\mathrm{V}\) to 0 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				The rest of the loop of the circuit from the 3 \(\Omega\) to the negative end of the battery is just ideal wire.
				So the voltage will not change along it and the voltage will be 0 \(\mathrm{V}\) at the negative terminal of the battery.
				This indicates that our calculations are correct.
				First, we calculated the equivalent resistance of the circuit
				and we used that information to determine that the voltage across the whole circuit should be 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
				Then we calculated the voltage across each point of the circuit accounting for drops in voltage due to resistive elements.
				When we got back to where we started, which is the battery element, the voltage is zero.
				This confirms are calculations are correct and is consistent with a total potential difference of 5 \(\mathrm{V}\)
				across the whole circuit.
				If we had some finite voltage when we got back to where we started then that would mean that either
				the total voltage is wrong or our calculated voltage drops are wrong.
				The battery acts differently than the resistors.
				Rather than causing a voltage drop, the battery increases the voltage.
				If we were to continue to traverse the circuit in the same clockwise direction,
				the voltage would go from 0 \(\mathrm{V}\) to 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) as we cross the battery.
				It is a 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) battery and thus increases the voltage by 5 \(\mathrm{V}\).
			</p>
			<h3>parallel circuits</h3>
			<p>
				Now let's consider a different configuration for a circuit.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img

					alt="a circuit with two resistors in parallel on the left and and an equivalent circuit on the right"

				<figcaption>
					FIG. 4. Resistors in parallel. (a) Two resistors of 2 \(\Omega\) and 3 \(\Omega\) in parallel are equivalent to (b) one resistor of 1.2 \(\Omega\). 
				</figcaption>
			<figure>
			<p>
				The 2 \(\Omega\) resistor and the 3 \(\Omega\) resistors in Fig. 4(a) are considered to be in parallel in the configuration depicted.
				Earlier we said that circuit elements in series have the same current across them.
				Analogously, circuit elements that are in parallel have the same voltage across them.
				Let's again assume that the battery is a 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) battery.
				Both the 2 \(\Omega\) and 3 \(\Omega\) resistors will have a voltage of 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) across them.
				The voltage will drop by 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) across both of them.
				Where the wires meet after the two parallel resistors, the voltage is zero.
				The voltage will remain zero as you travel clockwise along the rest of the circuit till we get back to the battery where
				the battery will increase the voltage by 5 \(\mathrm{V}\) again. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The voltage across two elements in parallel is the same, but the current could be different.
				You need to use Ohm's law to determine what the current is across each parallel element.
				Let's calculate the current across the 2 \(\Omega\) resistor.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V=IR\tag{14}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{V}{R}\tag{15}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{5~\mathrm{V}}{2~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{16}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=2.5~\mathrm{A}\tag{17}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The current across the 3 \(\mathrm{\Omega}\) resistor is
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{V}{R}\tag{19}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{5~\mathrm{V}}{3~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{20}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=1.67~\mathrm{A}\tag{21}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, let's figure out what the equivalent resistance of the two parallel resistors is just like we did with the two series resistors.
				With resistors in series it was pretty simple, we just added the resistances together.
				It is a bit more complicated for resistors in parallel.
				We need to use the following equation
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\tag{22}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the resistances of two resistors in parallel.
				\(R_{eq}\) is the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistor.
				This equation can be extended for more resistors in parallel.
				Just add extra terms on the right for additional parallel resistors like \(+\frac{1}{R_3}+\frac{1}{R_4}+...\) for example.
				Let's calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors in Fig. 4(a).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{1}{2~\mathrm{\Omega}}+\frac{1}{3~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{23}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\frac{1}{R_{eq}}=\frac{5}{6~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{24}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}R_{eq}=1.2~\mathrm{\Omega}\tag{25}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				So the circuit in Fig. 4(a) is equivalent to the circuit with just one resistor in Fig. 4(b).
			</p>
			<p>
				We can now perform a check on our circuit analysis so far.
				Let's calculate the current that the circuit in Fig. 4(b) must have using Ohm's law.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{V}{R}\tag{26}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=\frac{5~\mathrm{V}}{1.2~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{27}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I=4.17~\mathrm{A}\tag{28}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The two circuits in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) are equivalent.
				The current running through the simplified circuit is 4.17 \(\mathrm{A}\).
				In the circuit on the left with parallel elements, one elements has a current of 2.5 \(\mathrm{A}\)
				and the other element has a curent of 1.67 \(\mathrm{A}\).
				2.5 \(\mathrm{A}\) plus 1.67 \(\mathrm{A}\) is 4.17 \(\mathrm{A}\) which is the current across the equivalent.
			</p>
			<h3>
				AC circuits
			</h3>
			<p>
				All of the circuits we have discussed so far have been what are called direct current circuits.
				The voltage that is applied is constant in time and the current that it produces in the circuit is constant in time.
				DC circuits are actually very useful in creating computers.
				But it is still important to discuss circuits that do not have a constant voltage and current.
				There is a very important case of this where the current changes in time but does so periodically following a consistent pattern.
				Imagine the current forms a sine wave if you were to plot it on the y axis and time on the x-axis.
				We call this an alternating current (AC) circuit.
				In a DC circuit, the current is always flowing in one direction.
				In an AC circuit, the current is oscillating from positive to negative
				so the direction of flow of the actual charges is constantly switching from one direction to the opposite.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the voltage and current are not constant we describe them numerically by their root mean square
				<a

				[1]</a>.
				The form of the instantaneous voltage looks like
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V(t)=V_{max}\mathrm{sin}(\omega t)\tag{29}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
			To determine the root mean square, we first square the voltage.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V^2(t)=V_{max}^2\mathrm{sin}^2(\omega t)\tag{30}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Next we take the mean or average of the voltage.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\left&lt;V^2(t)\right&gt;_{avg}=\left&lt;V_{max}^2\mathrm{sin}^2(\omega t)\right&gt;_{avg}\tag{31}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				\(V_{max}^2\) is constant, so we can pull it out of the average.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\left&lt;V^2(t)\right&gt;_{avg}=V_{max}^2\left&lt;\mathrm{sin}^2(\omega t)\right&gt;_{avg}\tag{32}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				The average of the square of a sine is always \(1/2\). So we can say
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\left&lt;V^2(t)\right&gt;_{avg}=\frac{V_{max}^2}{2}\tag{33}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we take the square root of what we have so far.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}\sqrt{\left&lt;V^2(t)\right&gt;_{avg}}=\sqrt{\frac{V_{max}^2}{2}}\tag{34}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_{rms}=\frac{V_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}\tag{35}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				We define the square root of the mean of the square of the voltage as the root mean square (rms) voltage, \(V_{rms}\),
				and find that it is equal to the maximum voltage divided by the square root of two.
				This rms voltage is also a constant since \(V_{max}\) is constant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's consider a simple circuit with an alternating current voltage (VAC) source and a resistor or resistance, R.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img

				<figcaption>
					FIG. 5. A simple AC circuit with an AC voltage source on the left and resistor on the right. 
				</figcaption>
			<figure>
			<p>
				We have determined an expression for the rms voltage and now we can determine an expression for
				the rms current in this circuit.
				The instantaneous current across the resistor, \(I(t)\), is determined via Ohm's law
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I(t)=\frac{V(t)}{R}\tag{36}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				plugging in equation 29 we get
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I(t)=\frac{V_{max}\mathrm{sin}(\omega t)}{R}\tag{37}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				To determine the rms current we will follow the same procedures we used to get the rms voltage.
				After squaring, averaging, and taking the square root, the \(\mathrm{sin}(\omega t)\), becomes a factor of \(1/\sqrt{2}\).
				In addition \(I_{max}=V_{max}/R\) so
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I_{rms}=I_{max}/\sqrt{2}\tag{38}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<h3>
				inductors
			</h3>
			<p>
				We now will introduce new circuit elements that have special properties in AC circuits.
				The first new element is an inductor.
				Inductors are represented by a coil as depicted in Fig. 6.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img
					src="../images/L-circuit.svg"

					FIG. 6. a circuit with an ac voltage source and an inductor. 
				</figcaption>
			<figure>
			<p>
				Inductors typically are a coil.
				This is also called a solenoid.
				A loop of current produces a magnetic field.
				The Biot-Savart law determines the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying loop
				<a 
					href="references.html#ref-03"

				[3]</a>.
				It is an integral equation but one simple solution to it is the equation for the magnetic field at the center of a circular current loop
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2R}\tag{39}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(B\) is the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center,
				\(\mu_0\) is the permeability of free space,
				\(I\) is the current running through the loop,
				and \(R\) is the radius of the loop.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's consider a coil of several loops where the radius of the loop is much larger than the thickness of the stack of coils.
				The magnetic field will just be
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}B=\frac{N\mu_0I}{2R}\tag{40}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where N is the number of loops in the coil.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currents produce magnetic fields but recall from our electrodynamics discussion that a changing electric field produces a magnetic field
				and a changing magnetic field produces an electric field.
				If the current in our loop is alternating as in an AC circuit, then it will produce a changing magnetic field that increases and decreases.
				This changing magnetic field will then produce an additional electric field in the coil in addition to the electric field of the current.
				This electric field has an associated voltage that it induces in the circuit which opposes the voltage produced by the source.
			</p>
			<p>
				The strength of an inductor's ability to create this opposing magnetic field can be quantified by the inductance, \(L\).
				In general, the inductance of a coil is given by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}L=\frac{N\Phi_B}{I}\tag{41}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(\Phi_B\) is the magnetic flux through the coil.
				Calculus is needed to determine the magnetic flux in general.
				However, for simple geometries and a magnetic field, \(B\), perpendicular to the cross sectional area, \(A\), of the solenoid,
				the magnetic flux will be equal to \(BA\).
				Using that information and plugging Eq. 39 into Eq. 40,
				we find that the inductance of a solenoid is given by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}L=\mu_0n^2A\ell\tag{42}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(n\) is the number of coils per unit length and \(\ell\) is the length of the solenoid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's reconsider the circuit in Fig. 6.
				Resistors have a resistance R, and inductors have an analogous property called inductive reactance, \(X_L\),
				which is also in units of \(\Omega\).
				The inductive reactance is not a constant though, it depends on the frequency, \(f\), of the AC voltage.
				The angular frequency, \(\omega\), in radians is related to the frequency in hertz (\(\mathrm{Hz}\)) according to \(\omega=2\pi f\).
				Then inductive reactance of an inductor is given by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}X_L=\omega L\tag{43}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we can make a relation analogous to Ohm's law for the circuit depicted in Fig. 6.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I_{rms}=\frac{V_{rms}}{X_L}\tag{44}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<h3>
				capacitors

			<p>
				To illustrate how to analyze this circuit, let's consider an example.
				Assume the AC voltage source is 12 \(\mathrm{V}\) at 60 \(\mathrm{Hz}\), the resistance of the resistor is 15 \(\mathrm{\Omega}\),
				the inductance of the inductor is 50 \(\mathrm{mH}\), and the capacitance of the capacitor is 20 \(\mathrm{\mu F}\).
				First, let's calculate the inductive reactance, \(X_L\), of the inductor using Eq. 43.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}X_L=\omega L\tag{47}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\omega=2\pi f\tag{48}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_L=2\pi fL\tag{49}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_L=2\pi\left(60~\mathrm{Hz}\right)\left(50\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{H}\right)\tag{50}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_L=18.84~\mathrm{\Omega}\tag{51}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that we won't be strictly maintaining significant figures throughout these calculations.
				Next, we should calculate the capacitive reactance of the capacitor.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}X_C=\frac{1}{\omega C}\tag{52}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}\omega=2\pi f\tag{53}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_C=\frac{1}{2\pi fC}\tag{54}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_C=\frac{1}{2\pi\left(60~\mathrm{Hz}\right)\left(20\times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{F}\right)}\tag{55}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}X_C=132.63~\mathrm{\Omega}\tag{56}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we introduce the concept of impedance.
				With DC circuits, we calculate the equivalent resistance of the circuit.
				With AC circuits, we calculate the impedance of the circuit.
				Impedance has units of \(\Omega\).
				The impedance, \(Z\), of a series RLC circuit is given by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}Z=\sqrt{R^2+\left(X_L-X_C\right)^2}\tag{57}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's calculate the impedance of our example circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}Z=\sqrt{\left(15~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)^2+\left(18.84~\mathrm{\Omega}-132.63~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)^2}\tag{58}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}Z=114.77~\mathrm{\Omega}\tag{59}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we can determine the rms current using the impedance and source voltage, \(V_s\), with an equation that looks similar to Ohm's law.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I_{rms}=\frac{V_s}{Z}\tag{60}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's calculate the rms current of our circuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}I_{rms}=\frac{12~\mathrm{V}}{114.77~\mathrm{\Omega}}\tag{61}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}I_{rms}=0.1046~\mathrm{A}\tag{62}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we can use the rms current and Ohm's law to find the rms voltages across the resistor, inductor, and capacitor.
				First, we will calculate the rms voltage across the resistor, \(V_R\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V_{R}=I_{rms}R\tag{63}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_R=\left(0.1046~\mathrm{A}\right)\left(15~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)\tag{64}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_R=1.569~\mathrm{V}\tag{65}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, we will calculate the rms voltage across the inductor, \(V_L\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V_L=I_{rms}X_L\tag{66}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_L=\left(0.1046~\mathrm{A}\right)\left(18.84~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)\tag{67}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_L=1.971~\mathrm{V}\tag{68}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, we calculate the rms voltage across the capacitor, \(V_C\).
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V_C=I_{rms}X_C\tag{69}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_C=\left(0.1046~\mathrm{A}\right)\left(132.63~\mathrm{\Omega}\right)\tag{0}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_C=13.87~\mathrm{V}\tag{71}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				With DC circuits, if you add up the voltage from the source and subtract all the voltage drops across each element, it should sum to zero.
				We tested this earlier with our DC series circuit.
				This is an application of Kirchhoff's loop rule which states that the sum of the potential differences around a closed loop is always zero

				With AC circuits, we can't simply add the voltages together.
				We have to use the following equation.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V_s=\sqrt{V_R^2+\left(V_L-V_C\right)^2}\tag{72}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				So let's check if this holds true for our RLC circuit we have been discussing.
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}V_s=\sqrt{\left(1.569~\mathrm{V}\right)^2+\left(1.569~\mathrm{V}-13.87~\mathrm{V}\right)^2}\tag{73}\end{equation}
				\begin{equation}V_s=12.00~\mathrm{V}\tag{74}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				It works out to 12 \(\mathrm{V}\) which is the original source voltage that we set for our AC circuit.
				This confirms that our analysis was done correctly.
				This concludes our discussion of circuits and gives us some background that is useful for all electronics not just computers.
				However, we only scratched the surface of everything there is to know about DC and AC circuits.
				In the next section, we will discuss some important principles of solid state physics
				which will help us to better understand transistors which are a critical piece of technology that makes computing much easier.
