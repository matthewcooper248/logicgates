				solid state physics
			</h2>
			<p>
				This will really be a discussion of semiconductors which is a subset of the field
				of solid state physics which is a subset of the field of condensed matter physics.
				In quantum mechanics, a particle in a closed system can only take on discrete energies.
				For example, if a particle of mass \(m\) is in a one dimensional square well of length, \(L\),
				the quantized energies that the particle can take on are given by
			</p>
			<p>
				\begin{equation}E_n=n^2\left(\frac{\hbar^2\pi^2}{2mL^2}\right)\tag{75}\end{equation}
			</p>
			<p>
				where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant which is equal to \(6.626\times 10^{-34}\) joule hertz (\(\mathrm{J~Hz}\))
				and \(n\) is an integer that runs from \(1\) to infinity

				The electrons confined to the atoms in a solid also have only discrete energy levels that they can access.
				However, for some energy ranges, there are so many energy levels that it is as if there is a continuum
				of available energy levels.
				In other regions, though, there may be no energy levels so there can
				be an energy range which is a gap where no particles can have an energy within that range.
				The energy levels in an atom are defined by the valence electron shell of the atoms
				in the matrix of atoms in the solid.
				Electrons are identical particles.
				It doesn't matter which electron occupies the same valence energy level of any of the atoms.
				If all of the last valence electron orbitals of every atom are occupied,
				then no electrons can move.
				This means that no current can form along the material, and the material is an insulator.
				This is determined by the atomic number of the atoms.
				Another possibility is that the next highest energy level after the last occupied energy level
				is too high so there is no way an electron can get enough energy to move to the next level.
				If the valence electrons of all the atoms are only partially filled,
				then electrons are free to move.
				This means that currents can travel along the medium, and the material is a conductor.
			</p>
			<p>
				These gaps in available energy levels for electrons are called band gaps.
				A conductor with a band gap is depicted in Fig. 9(a)
				and an insulator with a band gap is depicted in Fig. 9(b).
			</p>

			<p>
				In the conductor (see Figure 9(a)), the electrons are occupying energy levels above the band gap.
				The highest energy level is full of atoms that are only partially occupied.
				The electrons at the highest energy level can move freely to vacant atoms at that energy level.
				If they receive a large enough increase, they could also potentially move to the energy level above.
				The electrons are free to move so this is a conductor.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the insulator (see Figure 9(b)), the highest energy level has all of its atoms occupied.
				the only possible way the electrons can move is if they received enough energy
				to jump to the next highest energy level.
				However, they would have to cross the band gap which is large enough
				that they can not possibly receive enough energy to cross the band gap to the next highest	
				accessible energy level.
				There is no way for electrons to move to a different occupation.
				Electrons cannot move so no current can flow.
				It is an insulator.
			</p>
			<p>
				This prepares us to discuss semiconductors.
				In a semiconductor, there is a band gap.
				However, the band gap is small enough that there is the possibility that electrons below the band gap
				could receive enough energy that they could jump across the band gap to the next highest energy level.
				This is depicted in Figure 10.

			</figure>
			<p>
				The band gap is large enough that electrons cannot jump across it under normal conditions.
				However, if a large enough electric potential difference is applied across the material,
				then the electrons can receive a large enough additional energy
				that they can cross the band gap.
				This is the crucial piece of information that will facilitate
				our transistors in the next section.
